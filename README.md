<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
 
* `Expo` was used to create a native Android app
* `Webview` was used to open my repository links in the app

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* Designing & Engineering the badges so that it displays greyed out when you have not collected it as yet
* Implementing an in-app QR code reader

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* Interfacing with Google and Facebook login functions
* Getting badges to be added when a user is created and also to make sure that it displays greyed out when not collected

### Reviews & Testing
<!-- stipulate how you've conducted testing in the form of peer reviews, feedback and also functionality testing, like unit tests (if applicable) -->
#### Unit Tests

`Unit Tests` were conducted to establish working functionality by myself.

* `Test 1` of confirming that the authentication functions work
* `Test 2` of confirming that the displaying of badges on home screen works
* `Test 3` of confirming that the SnapScan QR code reader works
* `Test 4` of confirming that the viewing of the website opens up in the app after clicking on it
* `Test 5` of confirming that the rewards screen show different badges when you collect them
* `Test 6` of confirming that the upload from profile picture works and update of profile information

#### UAT Tests

`User Acceptance Testing` were conducted to establish working functionality by my peers.

* `Peer One` did a unit test of the whole app and helped me by pointing out how to fix my UI designs to make it more user friendly
* `Peer Two` did a unit test to test if all the functionality was working perfectly.

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* To implement a function that already populates the volunteer form with user data when the user is logged in
* Linking the retailer apps of the stores to my app and not the online website of the retailer
